                    <h3>Early Foundations</h3>
                    <p>Key ideas began in the mid-20th century: Alan Turing's work on computation and the question "Can machines think?", followed by the Dartmouth workshop (1956) which coined "artificial intelligence." Early symbolic systems focused on logic, search, and knowledge representation.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Challenges & Limitations</h2>
                <p class="section-description">
                    Despite remarkable progress, AI faces significant technical, ethical, and societal 
                    challenges that must be addressed for responsible development.
                </p>
            </div>

                    <div class="challenge-icon">⚠️</div>
                    <h3>Technical Limitations</h3>
                    <p><strong>Data Dependency:</strong> AI systems require massive amounts of quality data to function effectively. Garbage in, garbage out—biased or incomplete data leads to flawed AI.</p>
                    <p><strong>Computational Costs:</strong> Training large AI models consumes enormous energy. GPT-3's training produced carbon emissions equivalent to driving a car for 700,000 miles.</p>
                    <p><strong>Brittleness:</strong> AI excels at specific tasks but fails catastrophically on edge cases. A self-driving car might misidentify a stop sign with stickers as something else entirely.</p>
                    <p><strong>Lack of Common Sense:</strong> AI doesn't understand the world the way humans do. It can't transfer knowledge between domains as flexibly as people.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="challenge-card">
                    <div class="challenge-icon">🔍</div>
                    <h3>Transparency & Explainability</h3>
                    <p><strong>Black Box Problem:</strong> Deep learning models make decisions through billions of parameters. Even AI creators often can't explain why a model reached a specific conclusion.</p>
                    <p><strong>Accountability Gap:</strong> When AI makes mistakes—misdiagnoses a disease, denies a loan unfairly—who is responsible? The developer? The company? The algorithm itself?</p>
                    <p><strong>Trust Issues:</strong> People struggle to trust systems they don't understand. This is particularly problematic in high-stakes domains like healthcare and criminal justice.</p>
                    <p><strong>Regulatory Challenges:</strong> How can we regulate what we can't fully understand? Explainable AI remains a critical research priority.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="challenge-card">
                    <div class="challenge-icon">⚖️</div>
                    <h3>Bias & Fairness</h3>
                    <p><strong>Historical Bias:</strong> AI trained on historical data inherits society's past biases. Hiring algorithms favor patterns from traditionally male-dominated fields, perpetuating inequality.</p>
                    <p><strong>Representation Gaps:</strong> Facial recognition works better on light-skinned faces because training datasets underrepresent people of color—leading to higher error rates that can have serious consequences.</p>
                    <p><strong>Feedback Loops:</strong> Biased AI decisions create biased data, which trains more biased AI. Predictive policing creates self-fulfilling prophecies by over-policing already targeted communities.</p>
                    <p><strong>Cultural Bias:</strong> Most AI development happens in wealthy Western countries, embedding their values and assumptions into global technologies.</p>

                <div class="challenge-card">
                    <div class="challenge-icon">🔒</div>
                    <h3>Security & Safety</h3>
                    <p><strong>Adversarial Attacks:</strong> Small, imperceptible changes to inputs can fool AI systems. Stickers on a stop sign can make a self-driving car ignore it.</p>
                    <p><strong>Weaponization:</strong> Autonomous weapons, deepfakes, and AI-powered surveillance raise existential concerns about AI in warfare and authoritarian control.</p>
                    <p><strong>Unintended Consequences:</strong> Optimization for specific goals can lead to unexpected harmful behaviors. An AI told to maximize engagement might promote addictive or divisive content.</p>
                    <p><strong>Existential Risk:</strong> Some experts worry that superintelligent AI could pose existential risks if not properly aligned with human values and interests.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="challenge-card">
                    <div class="challenge-icon">📊</div>
                    <h3>Data Privacy</h3>
                    <p><strong>Surveillance Capitalism:</strong> AI business models often depend on collecting vast personal data, commodifying human behavior and attention.</p>
                    <p><strong>Consent Challenges:</strong> Most people don't understand how their data is collected, used, or shared. "Agreeing" to terms of service doesn't mean informed consent.</p>
                    <p><strong>Data Permanence:</strong> Once collected, data about you exists forever and can be used in ways you never anticipated by AI systems that don't yet exist.</p>
                    <p><strong>Inference Risk:</strong> AI can infer sensitive information (health conditions, sexual orientation, political beliefs) from seemingly innocuous data like shopping habits or Facebook likes.</p>

                <div class="challenge-card">
                    <div class="challenge-icon">🌍</div>
                    <h3>Global Inequality</h3>
                    <p><strong>Digital Divide:</strong> AI benefits accrue primarily to wealthy nations with technical infrastructure. Developing countries risk being left further behind.</p>
                    <p><strong>Resource Extraction:</strong> AI companies extract valuable training data from users worldwide but concentrate profits in Silicon Valley and other tech hubs.</p>
                    <p><strong>Language Barriers:</strong> Most AI research focuses on English. Billions speaking other languages get inferior AI services.</p>
                    <p><strong>Brain Drain:</strong> Developing countries lose talented AI researchers to higher-paying opportunities in wealthy nations, hindering local AI development.</p>

The path to AGI and its consequences represent the most important question facing AI research.</p>

                <p class="conclusion-text">
                    Artificial Intelligence represents one of humanity's most powerful inventions—a technology 
                    with potential to solve our greatest challenges or amplify our worst failures. Unlike past 
                    technological revolutions, AI's development is happening at unprecedented speed, giving us 
                    little time to adapt.
                </p>
                <p class="conclusion-text">
                    The path forward requires wisdom, not just intelligence. We must be intentional about the 
                    AI future we create—prioritizing human wellbeing, equity, and flourishing over narrow 
                    commercial interests. This means strong governance, ethical development practices, public 
                    engagement, and global cooperation.
                </p>
                <p class="conclusion-text">
                    The question isn't whether AI will transform our world—that transformation is already 
                    underway. The question is whether we will shape that transformation to reflect our deepest 
                    values: justice, compassion, creativity, and human dignity. The choice, and the responsibility, 
                    belongs to all of us.
